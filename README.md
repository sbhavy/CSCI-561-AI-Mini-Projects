# CSCI-561-AI-Mini-Projects
Compilation of AI Mini Projects completed as a part of the course CSCI 561, Foundations of Artificial Intelligence (Prof. Laurent Itti, Spring 2024)

**Homework 1** involves the implementation of Breadth-First Search (BFS), Uniform-Cost Search (UCS), and A* search in C++ for a custom problem, i.e. motion of a rover on Martian soil. Special consideration is given to the surface elevation and the laws that govern the vertical movement of the rover. In all 3 search algorithms, an optimal path is returned.

**Homework 2** comprises the development of an AI game engine for a modified version of Othello. Custom heuristics were developed and coded in C++.

**Homework 3** requires the creation of a feed-forward neural network trained on the messy New York Housing Dataset to predict the number of bedrooms in a unit. EDA and Feature Engineering was done in Pandas, and the neural network was developed in pure NumPy.
